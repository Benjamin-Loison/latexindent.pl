Version 3: September 1st 2012
    - made \ optional when looking for commands that split {} across 
      lines; this is happens a lot in tikz keys
    - allowed $\begin{.*} to be matched as the beginning of an 
      environment, which is helpful for matching
        $\begin{aligned}
            ...
            ...
         \end{aligned}$
      and probably others

Version 2 (and below) August 28th 2012
    - indents environments
    - aligns at delimeter tabs (does not format rows with \multicolumn)
    - matches commands that have split {}
