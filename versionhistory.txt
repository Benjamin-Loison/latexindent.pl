Version 5: September 10th 2012
    - Made decrease_indent subroutine
    - can now account for verbatim environments using

        my %verbatim=("verbatim"=>1);

      environments in this hash table will not be changed at all
    - checks for commands that split [ ] across lines; 
      specify these commands in

        my  %checkunmatchedbracket=("pgfplotstablecreatecol"=>1,);

Version 4.1: September 5th 2012
    The check for ending a brace had this
        !($_ =~ m/^\s*(\\)?(.*?)(\[|{|=)/ 
    
    but it needs this
        !($_ =~ m/^\s*(\\)?(.*?)(\[|{|=|(\s*\\))/ 

    to account for commands like \foreach \x

Version 4: September 4th 2012
    - split the main loop into subroutines
    - added else construct indentation, for e.g
            \pgfkeysifdefined{/pgfplots/table/output empty row/.@cmd}{
            	% upcoming releases offer this more convenient option:
            	\pgfplotstableset{
            		empty header/.style={
            			every head row/.style={output empty row},
            		}
            	}
            }
            {
            	% versions up to and including 1.5.1 need this:
            	\pgfplotstableset{
            		empty header/.style={
            			typeset cell/.append code={%
            				\ifnum\pgfplotstablerow=-1 %
            				\pgfkeyssetvalue{/pgfplots/table/@cell content}{}%
            				\fi
            			}
            		}
            	}
            }
    - corrected spelling (delimeters-> delimiters)

Version 3: September 1st 2012
    - made \ optional when looking for commands that split {} across 
      lines; this happens a lot in tikz keys
    - allowed $\begin{.*} to be matched as the beginning of an 
      environment, which is helpful for matching
        $\begin{aligned}
            ...
            ...
         \end{aligned}$
      and probably others

Version 2 (and below) August 28th 2012
    - indents environments
    - aligns at delimeter tabs (does not format rows with \multicolumn)
    - matches commands that have split {}
